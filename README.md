## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Yashasrn33/flipkart-review-analysis.git
cd flipkart-review-analysis

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser. Upload a Flipkart reviews CSV file using the sidebar.

### Expected CSV Format

The CSV file should contain the following columns:

- `Product_name`: Name of the product
- `Review`: Text of the review
- `Rating`: Numerical rating (1-5)

Example:

```
Product_name,Review,Rating
Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3,Great performance and battery life,5
Dell Inspiron 15,Average build quality but good specs,3
```

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Processing**:

   - Reviews are cleaned to remove special characters and irrelevant text
   - Sentiment is analyzed using TextBlob to determine polarity (positive/negative)
   - Product features are extracted using keyword matching

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:

   - Each review is classified as Positive, Neutral, or Negative
   - Sentiment is derived from both review text and numerical ratings
   - Word clouds visualize common terms in positive and negative reviews

3. **Feature Analysis**:

   - Identifies features like performance, battery, display, design
   - Calculates sentiment for each specific feature
   - Determines strengths (positively mentioned features) and weaknesses (negatively mentioned features)

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Calculates product similarity based on review content (TF-IDF vectors)
   - Recommends similar products based on review content
   - Offers feature-based recommendations for finding products with specific characteristics
